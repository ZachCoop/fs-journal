## Questions

1. What is a Pseudo-Class and what are some of the most common ones you think you will use

- a class that is paired with an action. when a button changes color as the cursor hovers over it

2. What is Specificity and how might you use it to your benefit?

- gives a value for how important each css class is. can label all things in a class with a 0,0,1 specificity as one color, but change the color of specific objects by making their specificity larger

3. What problems do you think you could run into if you over-utilized the !important feature?

- it ruins the structure of the specificity caluculator. you would have to tag each object individually.
