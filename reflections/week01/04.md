## Questions

1. What is the purpose of wire-framing?

- To provide an overview/outline of the project

2. What are the different levels of detail in wire-frames and why is each one useful?

- Low-fidelity - useful to sketching the general idea of what each page should look like. 
- Mid-fidelity - useful for adding scaling and sizing of important objects to see how they fit on the webpage.
- High-fidelity - useful for giving the designer the exact layout and look of the webpage

3. Do you think wire-frames are worth the Time, Energy, and Effort that they require? Why or Why not?

- Yes because a layout will look different while being constructed, so it's good to get the general idea drawn out in case changes need to be made later. It is also important to help keep track of the code.
