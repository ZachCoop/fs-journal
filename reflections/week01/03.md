## Questions

1. What is your favorite tip that you think is the most beneficial to improving your design?

- Add extra spacing and use accent borders

2. Compile a couple resources that you think might be helpful when trying to review examples of good design ideas.

- unsplash.com, myfonts.com, colorhunt.com

3. How do you think good design influences people when visiting a website and what sorts of things could you convey through design alone?

- Good design is what attracts a customer in buying/visting a website. The more professional it looks, the more likely they are to buy-in to the content. Color schemes and artwork are kind to the eye as well. If a website is poorly designed, and hard to look at, they are likely to exit the webpage more quickly.
